As an employee of PyBer, a Python based ride sharing company, analyst has been requested to perform exploratory data analysis on multiple large format .csv files related to city and ride sharing data in order to facilitate better understanding of best use of investment resources based on profitability or growth opportunities across cities in the United States.  Data includes two .csv datasets, including City_Data, a listing of Cities and Ride_Data, a listing of information about drivers, the rides they host and the fares paid.  The following tables are short excerpts from these two tables.
